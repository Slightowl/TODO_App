    // Poem strings - Khalil Gibran

    <string-array name="khalil_poem">
        <item>Your children are not your children</item>
        <item>They are the sons and daughters of lifeÂ´s longing for itself</item>
        <item>They come through you but not from you</item>
        <item>And though they are with you, they belong not to you</item>
        <item>You may give them your love but not your thoughts</item>
        <item>For they have their own thoughts</item>
        <item>You may house their bodies but not their souls</item>
        <item>For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow</item>
        <item>Which you can not visit, not even in your dreams</item>
        <item>You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you</item>
        <item>For life goes not backwards nor tarries with yesterday</item>
        <item>You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth</item>
        <item>The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite</item>
        <item>And He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far</item>
        <item>Let your bending in the archers hands be for happiness</item>
        <item>For even as He loves the arrow that flies</item>
        <item>So He loves the bow that is stable</item>
